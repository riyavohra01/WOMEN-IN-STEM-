# WOMEN-IN-STEM-
1) I built an innovative platform showcasing the achievements, stories, and opportunities for women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. 
2) It is a dynamic website that promotes inclusivity, highlights successful women in STEM, and provides a space for networking and collaboration.  
3) The goal is to inspire the next generation of female STEM leaders and bridge the gender gap in theseÂ industries
